# POINTERS

You can add multiple pointers to the gauge to point at multiple values on the same scale. This can be useful for showing a low and a high value at the same time. The value of the pointer is set using the Value property. There are two types of pointers. You can choose a pointer using the `PointerType` property.

## Needle Pointer

A needle pointer contains two parts, the needle and the knob that can be placed on a gauge to mark values. The needle length is controlled by the `LengthFactor` property. The `LengthFactor` property’s minimum and maximum bounds are 0 and 1. The needle’s UI is customized by the `Color` and `Thickness` properties. The user can modify the Knob’s size by changing the `KnobRadius` property.

### NeedlePointerType

NeedlePointer appearance can be customized by using the Type property the default value of this property is Rectangle.

It is `enum` includes the following option.

* Bar
* Triangle

    SfCircularGauge circulargauge = new SfCircularGauge();
    Scale scale=new Scale();
    List<Pointer> pointers = new List<Pointer>();
    NeedlePointer needlePointer = new NeedlePointer();
    needlePointer.Value = 60;
    needlePointer.Color = Color.Gray;
    needlePointer.KnobRadius = 10;
    needlePointer.KnobColor = Color.FromHex("#797979");
    needlePointer.Thickness = 5;
    needlePointer.LengthFactor = 0.8;
    needlePointer.Type = PointerType.Bar;

    pointers.Add(needlePointer);
    scale.Pointers = pointers;
    circularGauge.Scales = scale;

{% endhighlight %}

## Range Pointer

A range pointer is an accenting line or shaded background range that can be placed on a gauge to mark values. The range pointer’s UI is customized by the `Color` and `Thickness` properties.

### RangePointerPosition

The `RangePointer` in the scale can be placed inside the scale or outside the scale by setting `Offset` property.

{% highlight c# %}

    SfCircularGauge circulargauge = new SfCircularGauge();

    Scale scale=new Scale();
    List<Pointer> pointers = new List<Pointer>();
    RangePointer rangePointer = new RangePointer();
    rangePointer.Value = 70;
    rangePointer.Color = Color.FromHex("#2bbfb8");
    rangePointer.Thickness = 10;
    pointers.Add(rangePointer);
    scale.Pointers = pointers;
    circularGauge.Scales = scale;

{% endhighlight %}

# Overview
The `SfMaskedEdit` control is an advanced version of the `EditText` control that restricts user input to certain types of characters, text, and numbers using a mask pattern. This control is used to create templates for providing structured information such as telephone numbers, IP addresses, product IDs, and similar data formats.

* Special symbols such as currency symbol, date separator, decimal separator, etc., can be localized based on the culture.

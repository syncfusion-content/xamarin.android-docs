# Overview

The SfComboBox is a text box component that allows users to type a value or choose an option from a list of predefined options. It provides several out-of-the-box features such as data binding, filtering, and UI customization.

## Key Features

* **Editable Mode** – Supports both editable and non-editable text boxes to choose a selected item from the given data source.

* **Filtering Mode** – Provides options to support both filtering and non-filtering suggestion lists. The ComboBox offers three different ways to display filtered suggestions: through a drop-down list, by appending the first suggestion to the text, or by combining both approaches.

* **Suggestion Modes** – Suggestions can be filtered using different modes such as StartsWith, EndsWith, Contains, Equals, and Custom. The ComboBox supports both case-sensitive and case-insensitive filtering. Items can be filtered only when the AllowFiltering property is enabled.

* **Multi-Selection** – Provides two different ways to select multiple items from the suggestion list using Token representation and Delimiter. In Token mode, text can be wrapped in two ways: Wrap and None. In Wrap mode, text wraps to the next line, while in None mode, text wraps horizontally.

* **Customization Support** – Provides options to customize both the Entry and Suggestion drop-down components.

* **Header and Footer** – Allows you to add header and footer content at the top and bottom of the suggestion list in the ComboBox.

* **Text Highlighting** – Highlights matching text in the suggestion list based on the user's input.

* **Watermark** – Displays explanatory text inside the ComboBox control until the user inputs text. The watermark is restored if the user clears the text.

# Views

Schedule control provides four different types of views to display dates. Day view, Week view, Work Week view and Month view. It can be assigned to the schedule control by using `ScheduleView` property. Based on the userâ€™s preference appointments can be viewed in any of the four type of view available. By default schedule control is assigned with day view.

## Day View

Day view is used to display a single day; current day will be visible by default. Appointments on a specific day will be arranged in respective timeslots based on its duration.

{% highlight c# %}

	//creating new instance for schedule
	sfschedule = new SfSchedule(this);

	//setting schedule view
	sfschedule.ScheduleView = ScheduleView.DayView;

	// Set our view from the "main" layout resource
	SetContentView(sfschedule);

{% endhighlight %}

### Settings

#### Date Time Formating

You can format the date and time string in the schedule control using `DayLabelSettings` of  `DayViewSettings` and the size of those strings are also customizable.

You can differentiate the timeslot panel using `VerticalLineColor` and `VerticalLineStrokeWidth` properties of `DayViewSettings`.To know more about customization of working hours refer [Timeslots Customization](/xamarin-android/sfschedule/appearance-and-styling "Timeslots Customization")

{% highlight c# %}

	//creating new instance for schedule
	sfschedule = new SfSchedule(this);

	//setting schedule view
	sfschedule.ScheduleView = ScheduleView.DayView;

	//setting day view settings properties
	DayViewSettings dayViewSettings = new DayViewSettings();
	dayViewSettings.WorkStartHour=10;
	dayViewSettings.WorkEndHour=18;
	sfschedule.DayViewSettings=dayViewSettings;

	// Set our view from the "main" layout resource
	SetContentView(sfschedule);

{% endhighlight %}

#### Non-Accessible Blocks

You can restrict/allocate certain timeslot as non-accessible block using `NonAccessibleBlocks` of `DayViewSettings`, so that you can allocate those timeslots for predefined events/activities like Lunch hour.

{% highlight c# %}

	//creating new instance for schedule
	sfschedule = new SfSchedule(this);

	//setting schedule view
	sfschedule.ScheduleView = ScheduleView.DayView;

	//setting non-accessing blocks.
	NonAccessibleBlocksCollection nonAccessibleBlocksCollection = new NonAccessibleBlocksCollection();
	NonAccessibleBlock lunchHour = new NonAccessibleBlock();
	lunchHour.StartTime=13;
	lunchHour.EndTime=14;
	lunchHour.Color=Color.Black;
	lunchHour.Text="LUNCH";
	nonAccessibleBlocksCollection.Add(lunchHour);
	dayViewSettings.NonAccessibleBlocks=nonAccessibleBlocksCollection;
	sfschedule.DayViewSettings=dayViewSettings;

	// Set our view from the "main" layout resource
	SetContentView(sfschedule);

{% endhighlight %}

#### Working Hours

You can modify the working hours using `WorkStartHour` and `WorkEndHour` properties of `DayViewSettings`.

You can also differentiate working hours with non-working hour timeslots by its color using `NonWorkingHoursTimeSlotBorderColor`, `NonWorkingHoursTimeSlotColor`, `TimeSlotColor`,`TimeSlotBorderColor` and `TimeSlotBorderStrokeWidth` properties of `DayViewSettings`.To know more about customization of working hours refer [Timeslots Customization](/xamarin-android/sfschedule/appearance-and-styling "Timeslots Customization")

	//setting day view settings properties
	DayViewSettings dayViewSettings = new DayViewSettings();
	dayViewSettings.WorkStartHour = 10;
	dayViewSettings.WorkEndHour = 18;
	sfschedule.DayViewSettings=dayViewSettings;

	// Set our view from the "main" layout resource
	SetContentView(sfschedule);

{% endhighlight %}

#### All Day Appointments Color

You can view All day appointments in separate panel and the panels visibility can be enabled by setting `ShowAllDay` property of DayViewSettings as true.Also you can change the all day appointment panel color using the property `AllDayAppointmentBackgroundColor`. To know more about customization of working hours refer [Timeslots Customization](/xamarin-android/sfschedule/appearance-and-styling "Timeslots Customization")

{% highlight c# %}

	//creating new instance for schedule

	// Set our view from the "main" layout resource
	SetContentView(sfschedule);

{% endhighlight %}

# Restrict User Selection

The SfRating control provides the ability to control user interaction through the `ReadOnly` property. When enabled, this property prevents users from modifying the rating value, making the control display-only while maintaining its visual appearance. 

N> By default, property value is set to False.

{% tabs %}

{% highlight C# %}

	   rating.ReadOnly= true;

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}

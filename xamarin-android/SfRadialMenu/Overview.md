# Overview

The SfRadialMenu control displays a hierarchical menu in a circular layout, optimized for touch-enabled devices. Typically used as a context menu, it can expose more menu items in the same space than traditional menus.

## Key features

* **Automatic item arrangement**: Supports automatic positioning and layout of menu items.
* **Item rotation**: Supports rotating menu items for enhanced visual presentation.
* **Custom views**: Supports custom views, including images and other UI elements.
* **Flexible item placement**: Provides options for users to position items as needed.
* **Floating layout**: Supports floating over existing layouts to avoid obscuring content behind the menu.
* **Built-in icon fonts**: Allows you to use built-in icon font options that provide vector images, eliminating image quality issues commonly encountered with traditional bitmap icons.
* **Complete customization**: Provides comprehensive customization options for the menu and its items, including colors, sizes, placement, and shapes using segmentation options.
